    distance.
    
    See the paper "Tries for Approximate String Matching" by Shang and Merrett for details. This
    implementation assumes that we set an upper bound on the allowed edit distance (treating anything

    Imposing a small upper bound allows us to prune the search space and make the search reasonably
